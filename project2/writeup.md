# **Traffic Sign Recognition** 

**Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Load the data set (see below for links to the project data set)
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report
---
### Writeup

### File Submitted
* writeup.md - This writeup
* Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb - Main jupyter notebook with all sources
* ./real_world - Folder containing 5 images used to test the model using realword examples
- Note: File Names are the actual labels so we can use them to see how good the model performed in real world
* lenet_trafficXXX - Tensor flow trained model files.
